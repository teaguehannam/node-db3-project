#### MVP
- x  write SQL statements for `northwind.db3` database. 
- x  write it inside the _queries.sql_ file under the corresponding comment.
- x  write the db helper methods for the `schemes` resource in `./schemes/scheme-model.js`

#### Schemes Schema

| field       | data type        | metadata                                            |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| scheme_name | string           | required, unique                                    |

#### Steps Schema

| field        | data type        | metadata                                            |
| :----------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| scheme_id    | unsigned integer | foreign key referencing scheme.id, required         |
| step_number  | unsigned integer | required                                            |
| instructions | string           | required                                            |

#### API

The following endpoints are available to test the functionality of the model methods.

-   `GET /api/schemes/` - gets master list of schemes (without steps)
-   `GET /api/schemes/:id` - gets a single scheme
-   `GET /api/schemes/:id/steps` - gets all steps for a given scheme, ordered correctly
-   `POST /api/schemes` - adds a new scheme
-   `PUT /api/schemes:id` - updates a given scheme
-   `DELETE /api/schemes/:id` - removes a given scheme and all associated steps

## Stretch Problems

-   In [SQL Try Editor at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top):
    -   Displays CategoryName and a new column called Count that shows how many products are in each category. Shows 8 records.
    -   Display OrderID and a column called ItemCount that shows the total number of products placed on the order. Shows 196 records.
-   Add the following method to your API
    -   `addStep(step, scheme_id)`: This method expects a step object and a scheme id. It inserts the new step into the database, correctly linking it to the intended scheme.
    -   You may use `POST /api/schemes/:id/addStep` to test this method.
